hello hello help me hello world hello hello hello help me please
this is a tiny dataset created for the char rnn experiment
we repeat some words and sentences so the file becomes longer
hello world, hello again, help me with homework, help me please
the model should now have enough characters to create sequences
add more sentences if you want to increase the dataset size
this is just a small example; for final training use a larger book text
